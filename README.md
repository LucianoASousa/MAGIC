## Game Modes ðŸŽ®
### Rules ðŸ“š
A game mode to play with your friend, which consists of taking two random cards that are present in MTG ARENA, so that you and your friend create decks with the following rules:

> 1. The deck must contain 40 cards.
> 2. It cannot contain more than two copies of the same card.
> 3. Deck colors must match the cards drawn.

> There are two game modes, they are similar but each one with its particularities.

**OBS: If you don't have the drawn card, press again.**

* Normal Mode

> * This game mode looks like any non-land permanent in the game.
> * Play a best-of-three deck in limited mode.

## Thanks
This project was born out of a need for a different game mode in ARENA, together with my cousin @caionikolas we created this model.
And thanks also to https://scryfall.com/ for releasing the API.
